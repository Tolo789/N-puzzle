# N-puzzle
42 project made with Nicolas Dudniczenko

### Objective
Create a program which solves N-puzzles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) using an implementation of an A* algorithm.
The program must allow to choose between 3 different kinds of admissible heuristics and must inform if the puzzle can be solved or not.
Moreover, when a solution is found, the program must display the steps to solve the puzzle and also the total number of nodes in the open list and its max number of nodes.
